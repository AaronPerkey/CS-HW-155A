# Queries
#1. A query to retrieve the main attributes of each person (their code, and last/first name)

#2. A query to retrieve the major fields for every person including their address (but excluding emails)

#3. A query to get the email addresses of a specific person

#4. A query to change the email address of a specific email record

#5. A query (or series of queries) to remove a specific person record

#6. A query to get all the items on a specific invoice record

#7. A query to get all the items purchased by a specific person

#8. A query to find the total number of sales made at each store

#9. A query to find the total number of sales made by each employee

#10. A query to find the subtotal charge of all products in each invoice (hint: you can take an aggregate of a mathematical expression). Do not include taxes.

#11. A query to detect invalid data in invoice as follows. In a single invoice, a particular product should only appear once since any number 
#of units can be consolidated to a single record. For example, an invoice should not have two records for fertilizer; one for 10 liters and another 
#for 25 liters. Instead, it should have a single record for 35 liters. Write a query to find any invoice that includes multiple instances of the same product. 
#If your database design prevents such a situation, you should still write this query (but of course would never expect any results).

#12. Write a query to detect a potential instance of fraud where an employee makes a sale to themselves (the same person is the sales person as well as the customer).
